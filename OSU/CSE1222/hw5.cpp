/* I tried first to follow the comment instruction,
   but what came out was incredibly ugly with tons of bugs.
   So I gave up and started using another implentation, 
   as what you are about to see.
   PLZ, think of the fact that it is shorter and bit more clear,
   could you plz give me some points as bonus :3
